## Staging Environment for Zebra MC93/94 Handheld Scanners  

**Overview:**  
Independently designed and implemented a robust, scalable staging environment for Zebra MC93 and MC94 handheld scanners, supporting seamless mass deployment across multiple service locations. This solution streamlined device provisioning, reduced manual configuration time, and ensured long-term maintainability.  

**Key Contributions:**  
- **Automated Deployment Framework:** Configured and optimized Zebra’s staging tool to enable zero-touch provisioning. Devices are now deployed effortlessly by scanning a single barcode, eliminating manual setup and reducing errors.  
- **Custom Android Work Environment:** Developed and implemented a secure, work-specific Android lockdown using an MDM. Designed an intuitive UI while enforcing strict access controls to maintain compliance with business requirements.  
- **Ongoing Maintenance & Optimization:** Manage all layers of the deployment lifecycle, including staging configurations, UI enhancements, and work profile updates. Regularly refine system parameters to enhance performance and security.  
- **Update Management & Version Control:** Established a structured repository for maintaining a catalog of compatible updates. Oversee the integration and rollout of OS updates, security patches, and application enhancements to ensure operational stability.  
- **Enterprise-Level Scalability:** Successfully deployed and actively manage dozens of devices across 18+ service locations, maintaining uptime, security, and performance.  
## Zebra Label Printer Integration with IBM i Operating System  

**Overview:**  
Designed and implemented a custom configuration for Zebra label printers to seamlessly integrate with an IBM i operating system environment. This project involved overcoming compatibility challenges by modifying firmware and leveraging vendor tools to ensure proper communication between the IBM i system and the new hardware.  

**Key Contributions:**  
- **Custom Firmware & Print Language Configuration:** Modified Zebra printer firmware to support Intermec Print Language (IPL), enabling compatibility with the IBM i system, which natively outputs in IPL rather than Zebra’s default language.  
- **Vendor Tool Utilization:** Leveraged Zebra’s proprietary tools to build and fine-tune a tailored configuration that met the organization’s specific printing requirements.  
- **Network & Deployment Optimization:** Configured the final units for network operation, ensuring seamless connectivity and reliable performance across multiple locations.  
- **Enterprise Rollout & Maintenance:** Successfully deployed and continue to maintain these printers across 19+ service locations, monitoring performance and resolving any integration issues as they arise.
